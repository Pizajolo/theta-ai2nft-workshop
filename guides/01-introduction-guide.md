# 1. Introduction - Theta AI2NFT Workshop

Welcome to the **Theta AI2NFT Workshop**! 🎨🤖⛓️

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to build a complete AI-powered NFT creation platform that seamlessly combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. By the end of this workshop, you'll have created a full-stack application that can generate images using AI and automatically mint them as NFTs on the Theta blockchain.

## 🚀 What You'll Build

You'll create an **AI to NFT Workshop** application that:
- **Generates images** from text prompts using state-of-the-art AI models
- **Processes conversations** with an intelligent AI assistant
- **Interact with the Theta Blockchain** Mints NFTs automatically from generated images
