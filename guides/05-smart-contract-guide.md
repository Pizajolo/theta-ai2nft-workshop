## üß† Step 1: Understanding Smart Contracts & NFTs

### **1.1 What Are Smart Contracts?**

**Smart contracts** are programs that run on blockchain networks. Think of them as:
- **Self-executing code** that automatically enforces rules
- **Transparent agreements** visible to everyone on the blockchain
- **Immutable logic** that can't be changed once deployed
- **Trustless systems** that don't require intermediaries

#### **Real-World Analogy**
Imagine a vending machine:
- **Input**: You insert money and select a product
- **Logic**: Machine checks if you paid enough
- **Output**: Dispenses product or returns money
- **No middleman needed!**

Smart contracts work similarly but on the blockchain.

### **1.2 What Are NFTs?**

**NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** are unique digital assets that:
- **Prove ownership** of digital content
- **Cannot be duplicated** - each has a unique ID
- **Are transferable** between wallets
- **Store metadata** linking to images, descriptions, etc.

#### **NFT vs Regular Tokens**
```
Regular Token (e.g., TFUEL):
- Each token = exactly the same
- 1 TFUEL = 1 TFUEL (fungible)

NFT:
- Each token = completely unique  
- Token #1 ‚â† Token #2 (non-fungible)
```

### **1.3 Theta Blockchain & TNT721**

**Theta** is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain that:
- **Supports Solidity** - Same programming language as Ethereum
- **Lower fees** - More affordable for development and minting
- **Fast transactions** - Quick confirmation times
- **EVM compatible** - Ethereum tools work on Theta

**TNT721** is Theta's NFT standard:
- **Identical to ERC721** - Same functions and behavior
- **Full compatibility** - Works with existing NFT tools
- **Battle-tested** - Based on OpenZeppelin's proven libraries

---

## üìú Step 2: Understanding [Our NFT Contract](../contracts/nft-contract.sol)

### **2.1 Contract Architecture**

Our AINFT contract uses a **modular approach** by inheriting from multiple libraries:

```solidity
contract AINFT is TNT721, TNT721Enumerable, TNT721URIStorage, Ownable {
    // Your custom logic here
}
```

#### **Library Breakdown**

| Library | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **TNT721** | Core NFT functionality | Mint, transfer, approve tokens |
| **TNT721Enumerable** | Token enumeration | Count tokens, list by owner |
| **TNT721URIStorage** | Metadata management | Unique URI per token |
| **Ownable** | Access control | Restrict functions to owner |

### **2.2 Key Functions Explained**

#### **Constructor**
```solidity
constructor() TNT721("AI NFT", "AINFT") Ownable() {}
```
- **Sets collection name**: "AI NFT"
- **Sets symbol**: "AINFT" (like a ticker symbol)
- **Establishes ownership**: Deployer becomes owner

#### **Safe Minting Function**
```solidity
function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) external onlyOwner {
    uint tokenId = totalSupply() + 1;
    _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
}
```

**Line-by-line breakdown**:
1. `external onlyOwner` - Only contract owner can call this
2. `uint tokenId = totalSupply() + 1` - Generate unique token ID
3. `_safeMint(to, tokenId)` - Create token and assign to address
4. `_setTokenURI(tokenId, uri)` - Set metadata URI for token

#### **Override Functions**
The contract includes several override functions required by Solidity:
- **Resolve inheritance conflicts** between multiple parent contracts
- **Ensure proper functionality** when multiple libraries are used
- **Maintain compatibility** with NFT standards

### **2.3 Why This Architecture?**

#### **Security Benefits**
- **OpenZeppelin libraries** - Audited and battle-tested code
- **Access control** - Only owner can mint (prevents unauthorized minting)
- **Safe transfers** - Built-in checks prevent lost tokens

#### **Functionality Benefits**
- **Enumerable** - Can list all tokens owned by an address
- **URI storage** - Each token can have unique metadata
- **Standard compliance** - Works with all NFT marketplaces

#### **Scalability Benefits**
- **Efficient storage** - Optimized gas usage
- **Extensible design** - Easy to add features later
- **Interoperability** - Compatible with existing tools

## üîß Step 3: Contract Compilation with Remix

### **3.1 Why Use Remix?**

**Remix IDE** is perfect for smart contract development because:
- **Browser-based** - No installation required
- **Built-in compiler** - Compiles Solidity automatically
- **Error checking** - Shows compilation errors in real-time
- **Testing tools** - Built-in deployment and testing
- **Free to use** - No setup costs

### **3.2 Setting Up Your Contract**

#### **Step 3.2.1: Access Remix**
1. **Open Remix**: Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. **Familiarize yourself** with the interface:
   - **File Explorer** (left): Manage contract files
   - **Editor** (center): Write your code
   - **Terminal** (bottom): See compilation results

#### **Step 3.2.2: Create Contract File**
1. **Click "Create New File"** in the File Explorer

   <img src="./images/remix-newfile.png" alt="Remix create new file" width="500"/>

2. **Name your file**: `AINFT.sol`
3. **Copy the complete contract code** from [`contracts/nft-contract.sol`](../contracts/nft-contract.sol)
4. **Paste it** into your new file

### **3.3 Compilation Process**

#### **Step 3.3.1: Configure Compiler**
1. **Go to Solidity Compiler tab** (left sidebar)
2. **Set compiler version**: `0.8.19`
   - **Why this version?** It's stable and widely supported
   - **Compatibility**: Works well with OpenZeppelin libraries
3. **Leave optimization OFF** for now (easier debugging and verification in explorer)

#### **Step 3.3.2: Compile Contract**
1. **Click "Compile AINFT.sol"**

   <img src="./images/remix-compiler.png" alt="Remix compile file" width="500"/>

2. **Check for success**:
   - ‚úÖ **Green checkmark** = Compilation successful
   - ‚ùå **Red X** = Compilation failed (check errors in terminal)

#### **Step 3.3.3: Extract Deployment Data**
After successful compilation:
1. **Select "AINFT"** from the contract dropdown
2. **Copy the ABI** (Application Binary Interface):
   - **What is ABI?** - Interface that tells other programs how to interact with your contract
3. **Copy the Bytecode**:
   - **What is Bytecode?** - The compiled contract code that runs on the blockchain

**üí° Pro Tip**: Save both ABI and Bytecode in separate text files - you'll need them for deployment!

### **3.4 Understanding Compilation Output**

#### **What Happens During Compilation**
```
Solidity Code ‚Üí Compiler ‚Üí Bytecode + ABI
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
Human readable ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Machine code + Interface
```

#### **Common Compilation Issues**

| Error Type | Common Cause | Solution |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Syntax Error** | Missing semicolon, bracket | Check syntax carefully |
| **Version Mismatch** | Wrong Solidity version | Use version 0.8.19 |
| **Import Issues** | Missing dependencies | Use the flattened contract |

## üåê Step 4: Wallet Setup & Testnet Configuration

### **4.1 Why Theta Web Wallet?**

**Theta Web Wallet** is the official wallet that:
- **Native Theta support** - Built specifically for Theta blockchain
- **Contract deployment** - Built-in deployment tools
- **Testnet access** - Easy switching between mainnet/testnet
- **Faucet integration** - Get free testnet tokens instantly

### **4.2 Creating Your Wallet**

#### **Step 4.2.1: Wallet Creation**
1. **Go to** [wallet.thetatoken.org](https://wallet.thetatoken.org)
2. **Click "Create Wallet"**
3. **Follow the setup process**:
   - **Generate seed phrase** - Write this down and store securely!
   - **Download keystore file** - Save this file safely
   - **Set a strong password** - You'll need this often

#### **Step 4.2.2: Security Best Practices**
- **Never share your seed phrase** - Anyone with it controls your wallet
- **Backup your keystore file** - Store in multiple secure locations
- **Use a strong password** - Your keystore encryption depends on it
- **Test with small amounts** - Always verify everything works first

#### **Step 4.2.3: Unlock Your Wallet**
1. **Upload your keystore file**
2. **Enter your password**
3. **Access your wallet dashboard**

### **4.3 Switching to Testnet**

#### **Step 4.3.1: Network Selection**
1. **Click the network selector** at the top left (shows "Mainnet | Main Chain")
2. **Select "Testnet | Main Chain"**

   <img src="./images/wallet-select-chain.png" alt="Theta Wallet select testnet" width="500"/>

3. **Confirm the switch** - Interface should now show "Testnet"

#### **Step 4.3.2: Understanding Testnets**
**Testnets** are identical copies of the main blockchain but:
- **Free tokens** - Get test TFUEL for free
- **Safe experimentation** - Mistakes don't cost real money
- **Same functionality** - Everything works like mainnet
- **No real value** - Test tokens have no monetary worth

### **4.4 Getting Testnet TFUEL**

#### **Step 4.4.1: Using the Faucet**
1. **Click "Receive"** in your wallet
2. **Click "Faucet"**
3. **Wait for confirmation** - Should receive testnet TFUEL in ~20 seconds
4. **Verify balance** - Check that your balance increased

#### **Step 4.4.2: Why You Need TFUEL**
- **Gas fees** - Every blockchain operation costs gas
- **Contract deployment** - Deploying contracts requires gas
- **Future transactions** - Minting NFTs will also need gas

**üí° Gas Costs on Theta:**
- **Contract deployment**: ~16 TFUEL
- **NFT minting**: ~1-3 TFUEL per mint
- **Very affordable** compared to Ethereum!

## üöÄ Step 5: Smart Contract Deployment

### **5.1 Understanding Contract Deployment**

When you deploy a contract:
1. **Bytecode is sent** to the blockchain
2. **Contract gets an address** (like 0x742d35Cc6aB...)
3. **Code becomes immutable** - can't be changed
4. **Contract is publicly accessible** - anyone can interact with it

### **5.2 Deployment Process**

#### **Step 5.2.1: Navigate to Contract Tab**
1. **In Theta Web Wallet**, click the **"Contract"** tab in the top navigation
2. **You'll see deployment form** with fields for ABI and Bytecode

#### **Step 5.2.2: Input Contract Data**
1. **Paste ABI** from Remix into the "ABI" field
2. **Paste Bytecode** from Remix into the "Bytecode" field

   <img src="./images/deploy-contract.png" alt="Theta Wallet deploy contract" width="500"/>

3. **Review the information**:
   - **Constructor parameters**: None needed for our contract
   - **Gas limit**: Will be estimated automatically

#### **Step 5.2.3: Deploy Contract**
1. **Click "Deploy Contract"**
2. **Wait for transaction confirmation** (~5-10 seconds)
3. **Save your contract address** - You'll see it displayed at the top

**üéâ Congratulations!** Your smart contract is now live on the Theta testnet!

### **5.3 Testing Your Deployment**

#### **Step 5.3.1: Basic Function Test**
1. **Select a read function** (e.g., "owner")
2. **Click "Read"**
3. **Verify result** - Should return your wallet address

#### **Step 5.3.2: Understanding Contract State**
Your newly deployed contract:
- **Has 0 NFTs** - Nothing minted yet
- **You are the owner** - Only you can mint
- **Is ready for minting** - All functions available

---

## üîç Step 6: Contract Verification

### **6.1 Why Verify Your Contract?**

**Contract verification** makes your contract:
- **Transparent** - Anyone can read the source code
- **Trustworthy** - People can verify what the contract does
- **Interoperable** - Block explorers can decode function calls
- **Professional** - Shows you follow best practices

### **6.2 Theta Explorer Verification**

#### **Step 6.2.1: Access Theta Explorer**
1. **Go to** [testnet-explorer.thetatoken.org](https://testnet-explorer.thetatoken.org)
2. **Search for your contract address**
3. **Click on your contract** in the search results

#### **Step 6.2.2: Navigate to Verification**
1. **Click the "Contract" tab**
2. **You'll see verification form** if contract isn't verified yet

#### **Step 6.2.3: Fill Verification Form**
1. **Compiler version**: `v0.8.19`
2. **Optimization**: `No`
3. **Solidity Source Code**: Copy the complete code from [`contracts/nft-contract.sol`](../contracts/nft-contract.sol)
4. **Leave other fields** as default

   <img src="./images/verify-contract.png" alt="Explorer verify contract" width="500"/>

#### **Step 6.2.4: Submit Verification**
1. **Click "Verify and Publish"**
2. **Wait for processing** (~30 seconds)
3. **Check for success message**

‚úÖ **Success!** Your contract is now verified and publicly viewable.

### **6.3 Exploring Your Verified Contract**

After verification, you can:
- **Read contract code** directly in the explorer
- **See function calls** in transaction details
- **View contract events** and logs
- **Interact with contract** through the explorer interface

---

## üß™ Step 7: Testing & Validation

### **7.1 Contract Function Testing**

#### **Test Read Functions**
In Theta Explorer or Web Wallet, test these functions:

```solidity
// Should return your wallet address
owner()

// Should return "AI NFT"  
name()

// Should return "AINFT"
symbol()

// Should return 0 (no tokens minted yet)
totalSupply()
```

#### **Understanding Function Results**
- **owner()**: Confirms you control the contract
- **name() & symbol()**: Verifies contract metadata
- **totalSupply()**: Shows current NFT count (should be 0)

---

## üîß Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **8.1 Compilation Errors**

#### **"Compiler version mismatch"**
**Solution**: Ensure you're using Solidity 0.8.19 in Remix

#### **"Import resolution failed"**
**Solution**: Use the flattened contract from the repository - it includes all dependencies

#### **"Syntax error"**
**Solution**: 
- Check for missing semicolons
- Verify all brackets are closed
- Ensure proper indentation

### **8.2 Deployment Issues**

#### **"Insufficient gas"**
**Solution**: 
- Get more testnet TFUEL from the faucet
- Wait for previous transactions to confirm

#### **"Transaction failed"**
**Solution**:
- Check network connection
- Verify you're on Theta testnet

#### **"Contract deployment failed"**
**Solution**:
- Verify ABI and bytecode are complete
- Check for compilation errors first
- Try deploying again after a few minutes

### **8.3 Verification Problems**

#### **"Verification failed"**
**Solution**:
- Double-check compiler version (0.8.19)
- Ensure optimization is set to "No"
- Copy the exact source code from the repository
- Make sure contract address is correct

#### **"Source code mismatch"**
**Solution**:
- Use the flattened contract file
- Don't modify the code before verification
- Ensure you're using the same compiler settings
